<h3><u><a href="https://blog.naver.com/donotenvy" target="_blank" title="stuff happens naver blog">stuffhappens</a></u></h3> began in June when I was 28. It means, "That's possible."
The world is a series of coincidences so No one knows what will happen tomorrow right now.<p>Therefore, letâ€™s not put too much importance on what happened today that was stressful and think that it may happen too and get over it</p>
<p style="margin-top:20px;">I have a colleague at this beginning. His name is Kim, a friend I have met since I was 11 years old and we are still friends who support each other's dreams. He is a designer of our company and will develop together in the future.</p>
